# RC Self-Balancing Mini-Segway
##### BlueStamp Engineering Program

This is a project I did in the summer after my sophomore year of high school with the BlueStamp Engineering Program. It contains the code that I wrote to build the final product. I had a blast building it during my 6 weeks with BlueStamp, and I actually still have the mini-segway at home! You can see my progress and milestone videos at the BlueStamp website [here](https://bluestampengineering.com/student-projects/shawheen-a/).

The parts I used were:
- an Arduino Due
- a Sparkfun IMU
- 2 DC motors with encoders
- A dual motor controller
- Sony PS4 Bluetooth controller
