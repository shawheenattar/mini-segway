Claire Huang - Bluestamp 2014, Self Balancing Robot
==============

This repository holds all of the sketches I wrote over the course of my 6 weeks at [Bluestamp Engineering](http://bluestampengineering.com/), from my very first blink program to the [final code](https://github.com/16chuang/Bluestamp-2014/tree/master/Motor_and_IMU). All of the library files used in the final sketch (including my custom libraries) are included as well. View the rest of my progress, schematics, BOM, and videos [here](http://bluestampengineering.com/portfolio-view/claire-h/).
